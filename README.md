# DeFlock

A comprehensive Flutter app for mapping public surveillance infrastructure with OpenStreetMap. Includes offline capabilities, editing ability, and an intuitive interface.

**DeFlock** is a privacy-focused initiative to document the rapid expansion of ALPRs, AI surveillance cameras, and other public surveillance infrastructure. This app aims to be the go-to tool for contributors to map surveillance devices in their communities and upload the data to OpenStreetMap, making surveillance infrastructure visible and searchable.

## CYD Flock-You Companion Branch

This branch adds Android companion support for the CYD Flock-You field sensor. The matching firmware repository is [`yetisoldier/CYD-Flock-You`](https://github.com/yetisoldier/CYD-Flock-You).

Use these together:

- Android companion: [`yetisoldier/deflock-app`, branch `cyd-flock-you-integration`](https://github.com/yetisoldier/deflock-app/tree/cyd-flock-you-integration)
- CYD firmware: [`yetisoldier/CYD-Flock-You`](https://github.com/yetisoldier/CYD-Flock-You)
- Firmware protocol notes: [`docs/deflock-pairing-protocol.md`](https://github.com/yetisoldier/CYD-Flock-You/blob/main/docs/deflock-pairing-protocol.md)

The CYD scans passively for Flock-style 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signatures. The app connects over Bluetooth LE, streams phone GPS to the CYD, receives detection events, suppresses likely duplicates, and opens the normal DeFlock review flow so the user can manually place the camera and set direction before any OpenStreetMap upload.

### v2.11.0 Changes

- **CYD Flock-You integration** — Full BLE connection, GPS streaming, and detection event handling
- **Follow-me map smoothing** — Smooth follow-me map movement for a more fluid tracking experience
- **Map jitter reduction** — Reduced map jitter during navigation for a cleaner visual experience
- **CYD integration documentation** — Added docs for CYD companion device setup and usage

This is public-beta companion work and is not part of upstream DeFlock releases yet.

## What This App Does

- **Map surveillance infrastructure** including cameras, ALPRs, gunshot detectors, and more with precise location, direction, and manufacturer details
- **Upload to OpenStreetMap** with OAuth2 integration (live or sandbox modes)
- **Work completely offline** with downloadable map areas and device data, plus upload queue
- **Multiple map types** including satellite imagery from Bing Maps, USGS, Esri, Mapbox, and topographic maps from OpenTopoMap, plus custom map tile provider support
- **Editing Ability** to update existing device locations and properties
- **Built-in device profiles** for Flock Safety, Motorola, Genetec, Leonardo, and other major manufacturers, plus custom profiles for more specific tag sets

---

## Key Features

### Map & Navigation
- **Multi-source tiles**: Switch between OpenStreetMap, Bing satellite imagery, USGS imagery, Esri imagery, Mapbox, OpenTopoMap, and any custom providers
- **Offline-first design**: Download a region for complete offline operation
- **Smooth UX**: Intuitive controls, follow-me mode with GPS rotation, compass indicator with north-lock, and gesture-friendly interactions
- **Device visualization**: Color-coded markers showing real devices (blue), pending uploads (purple), pending edits (grey), devices being edited (orange), and pending deletions (red)

### Device Management
- **Comprehensive profiles**: Built-in profiles for major manufacturers (Flock Safety, Motorola/Vigilant, Genetec, Leonardo/ELSAG, Neology) plus custom profile creation
- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, edit, and delete surveillance devices
- **Multi-direction support**: Devices can have multiple viewing directions (e.g. "90;180") with individual field-of-view cones
- **Direction visualization**: Interactive field-of-view cones showing camera viewing angles with opacity-based selection
- **Bulk operations**: Tag multiple devices efficiently with profile-based workflow

### Surveillance Intelligence
- **Suspected locations**: Display potential surveillance sites from utility permit data with dynamic field display (select locations, more added regularly)
- **Proximity alerts**: Get notified when approaching mapped surveillance devices, with configurable distance and background notifications
- **Location search**: Find addresses and points of interest to aid in mapping missions

### Professional Upload & Sync
- **OpenStreetMap integration**: Direct upload with full OAuth2 authentication
- **Upload modes**: Production OSM, testing sandbox, or simulate-only mode
- **Queue management**: Review, edit, retry, or cancel pending uploads
- **Changeset tracking**: Automatic grouping and commenting for organized contributions

### Profile Import & Sharing
- **Deep link support**: Import custom profiles via `deflockapp://profiles/add?p=<base64>` URLs
- **Website integration**: Generate profile import links from [deflock.me](https://deflock.me)
- **Pre-filled editor**: Imported profiles open in the profile editor for review and modification
- **Seamless workflow**: Edit imported profiles like any custom profile before saving

### Offline Operations
- **Smart area downloads**: Automatically calculate tile counts and storage requirements
- **Device caching**: Offline areas include surveillance device data for complete functionality without network
- **Global base map**: Permanent worldwide coverage at low zoom levels
- **Robust downloads**: Exponential backoff, retry logic, and progress tracking for reliable area downloads

## Privacy & Ethics

This project helps make existing public surveillance infrastructure transparent and searchable. We only document surveillance devices that are already installed and visible in public spaces.

No user information is ever collected, and no data leaves your device except submissions to OSM and whatever data your tile provider can glean from your requests.
